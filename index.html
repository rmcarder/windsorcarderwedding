We felt this mission captured so much of our purpose for gathering with you all.</p>

                    <p class="text-black-50">We so appreciate the time and resources it will take to come to Asheville, and we completely understand if traveling to Asheville for the weekend does not make sense for you.</p> 
                    <p class="text-black-50">If you're flying in, Asheville Regional Airport (AVL) would be the most convenient, as it's only a 20 minute drive/Uber to downtown. It's a small airport, however, and may not have too many direct flights. Another option is to fly to a larger airport and rent a car, such as Charlotte (CLT - about a 2 hour drive), or Atlanta (ATL - about a 3.5 hour drive).</p>
                     <p class="text-black-50">We have blocks at two hotels, listed below. Please use the links provided here to book to get the block rates. We tried to secure the lowest price possible for the group rates, but given the busy weekend these still ended up higher than we would have liked.

The property features 16 tiny A-frame cabins with all the comforts, including a private bathroom, HVAC, and high-speed WiFi. A communal River Lodge with a canteen, lounge, and event space anchors the property as a place to eat, drink, gather, and shop. We don't have a room block, and availability seems limited, but we just recently found out about these and thought they looked really cool and so wanted to include them here!</p>

                    <p class="text-black-50">School buses will provide transportation to and from the wedding venue on Saturday. Please meet the bus out front of the Crowne Plaza lobby at <b>2:45pm</b> (there is plenty of parking at the Crowne Plaza, and it is accessible via Uber/Lyft). It will be about a 35 minute ride to the venuw. There will be return trips at 8:45pm and 10:15pm. We <em>highly recommend</em> that you take the provided transportation, even if you are not staying at the Crowne Plaza. The roads near the venue are dark and winding, so we do not recommend driving, and Ubers/Lyfts will not be available from the venue.</p>


                    <p class="text-black-50">If you decide to drive to the wedding venue on Saturday, please be aware that Google Maps will say you're there before you actually are. When Google says you've arrived, you'll see Lanzi Ledge Rd to the left. GO PAST IT!! There will be an unmarked paved road on the left, which is Loy Ingle. Turn left and follow this road until you come to the parking lot on the left. See the map below for more detail. </p>

                        <h2>More Details</h2>

                        
                        <h4>What will the Saturday wedding event entail?</h4>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We will have transportation to and from the venue, a ceremony, a cocktail hour that flows into the dinner reception, a dance party, and a fire pit. Beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and food will be provided by Jack's Mobile Bar and our caterer, King of Fire. We will have appetizers, wood-fired pizzas, salads, and desserts.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The event is fully outside and so will be subject to the natural elements, but will go on rain or shine (as long as it can safely)! The venue has a permanent covered event pavilion and paved floor, and we have rented an extra tent in case of rain.
                        </p>
                        <p> </p>  <p> </p>

                        <h4>Will Hurricane Ian affect the plans?</h4>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">It's very possible that Hurricane Ian will throw a curveball at us in some way, but the celebration will go on (as long as it can safely)! We're monitoring the path, strength, and the types of weather it may bring to Asheville over the weekend. Currently, it appears that there is a good chance of rain for at least some of the day on both Friday and Saturday. We have a rain plan that includes an extra tent for the wedding on Saturday. Still, please bring an umbrella; rain boots could also be helpful if you have them.</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We understand this may also affect travel to Asheville, espcecially for those of you coming from Florida. Please keep us posted about your plans if anything changes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> </p>  <p> </p>


                        <h4>Will I be able to use Uber and Lyft to get around?</h4>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Ubers and Lyfts are plentiful in downtown and West Asheville. However, they will not be available to get home from the wedding venue. There is neither reliable cell phone service nor a supply of rideshare vehicles there. Therefore we highly recommend that you plan to take the school buses to and from the venue, which leave at 2:45pm from the Crowne Plaza, and will have return trips at 8:45pm and 10:15pm. For the Friday night welcome party, Uber and Lyft should be easy.</p>
                        <p> </p>  <p> </p>



                        <h4>What should I wear?</h4>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">For the Saturday wedding celebration at Lady Luck, we encourage you to wear what makes you happiest and most comfortable. We are calling the attire "festive garden party." Interperet that how you like. Do keep in mind that we will be outside on grass and gravel, which could be unstable or possibly muddy, so comfortable shoes are encouraged! Also please prepare for rain, and the chance that it could be cold. The current forecast indicates that it could get into the low 50s later in the night. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.</p>
                        <p> </p>  <p> </p>

                        <h4>How are you handling COVID-19?</h4>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We recognize the impacts and uncertainty of the ongoing pandemic. We encourage guests to please take a rapid COVID test before joining us. We are expecting up to 100 people, and so we understand if gatherings don't feel comfortable for you at this time. The Saturday wedding celebration will take place outdoors at Lady Luck Gardens. The Friday welcome party will take place partially indoors and outdoors at Cellarest Beer Project. Please feel free to wear masks at any time, though they will not be required.
<!-- 

                         We encourage COVID-19 testing before you join any of the gatherings. Please feel free to wear masks at any time or social distance to your liking.

                        <h4>What about mobility?</h4>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We have planned for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner reception to take place across different areas of the Lady Luck venue (approximately 2-5 minute walk between areas). Our amazing planning team at Rising Fern Events will ensure everyone knows where to be at each point. If you will need assistance moving from place to place, please let us know so we can help coordinate a car. There will be two restrooms, and the right-side one is wheelchair accessible.</p>

They ask that guests be respectful of the farm crops and land by staying on designated paths. They also ask that guests do not try to pet any of the farm animals or bother them in any way.</p>

For mountain views while you grab a meal or a drink, check out the Montford rooftop bar or Omni Grove Hotel (a bit out of town but worth it - especially for sunset).
